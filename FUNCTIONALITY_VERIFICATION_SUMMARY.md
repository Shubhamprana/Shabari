## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Subscription Store Architecture
```typescript
// Current State (Testing Mode)
isPremium: true // ⚠️ Default for testing - should be false in production

// Database Integration
✅ Syncs with Supabase user.is_premium field
✅ Handles subscription expiration
✅ Auth state change listeners
✅ Local storage persistence
```

### Premium Feature Gating Pattern
```typescript
// All services implement this pattern:
const { isPremium } = useSubscriptionStore.getState();
if (!isPremium) {
    // Show upgrade prompt or fallback to manual
    return false;
}
// Proceed with premium functionality
```

### Universal Services Compatibility
- ✅ **Runtime Detection**: Platform.OS + build environment
- ✅ **Notification Service**: Expo Notifications integration
- ⚠️ **File System Service**: Implementation needs verification
- ⚠️ **Share Intent Service**: Implementation needs verification
- ⚠️ **Google Auth Service**: Implementation needs verification
