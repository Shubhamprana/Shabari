# YARA Engine Integration Summary

## Current Status

The app is currently using the **Mock YARA Engine** as a fallback because the native YARA engine is not properly integrated into the Android build system.

## Issues Found

1. **Missing YaraPackage.java** - ✅ Fixed
   - Created the missing `YaraPackage.java` file that registers the native module

2. **No Expo Plugin Configuration** - ✅ Fixed
   - Created `app.plugin.js` for Expo to automatically configure the native module
   - Added plugin to `app.config.js`

3. **Native Module Not Registered**
   - The YaraPackage needs to be registered in MainApplication
   - This will be done automatically by the Expo plugin when building

4. **Fallback Handling** - ✅ Fixed
   - Updated `index.js` to properly handle cases where native module is not available

## How It Works

### Development Mode (Expo Go)
- **Always uses Mock YARA Engine**
- Provides simulated threat detection
- Good for UI/UX testing

### Production Mode (APK/AAB)
- **Uses Native YARA Engine** (after proper build)
- Real malware detection with actual YARA rules
- C++ native implementation for performance

## Steps to Enable Native YARA Engine

1. **Clean the build cache:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Rebuild the Android app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   # OR for production build
   eas build --platform android
   ```

3. **Verify Integration:**
   - Check logs for "Native YARA Engine loaded successfully"
   - If you see "Native YARA not available, using mock engine", the native module is not loaded

## Testing Which Engine is Active

In your app, check the console logs or add this debug code:

```javascript
import { YaraSecurityService } from './src/services/YaraSecurityService';

// Check engine status
const status = await YaraSecurityService.getEngineStatus();
console.log('YARA Engine Status:', {
  isNative: status.native,
  version: status.version,
  initialized: status.initialized
});
```

## Important Notes

1. **The native YARA engine will NOT work in:**
   - Expo Go app
   - Web platform
   - iOS (not implemented yet)

2. **The native YARA engine WILL work in:**
   - Android APK builds
   - Android AAB builds
   - Development builds with `expo run:android`

3. **After making these changes:**
   - You need to rebuild the Android app
   - The first build might take longer as it compiles the C++ code
   - Subsequent builds will be faster due to caching

## Verification

After building, the app will automatically detect and use the native YARA engine if available. You can verify this by:

1. Looking for log messages during app startup
2. Checking the scan results - they should show "YARA Engine v4.5.0" instead of "Mock YARA v4.5.0"
3. Using the debug status check mentioned above
